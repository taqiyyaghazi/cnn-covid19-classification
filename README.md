# Image Recognition for X-Ray COVID-19 & Pneumonia

Image recognition to detect early diagnoses of people with COVID-19 or Pneumonia
using patient x-rays. This project is a personal experiment for
apply the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm in recognizing X-Ray images
as an initial diagnosis whether the patient has COVID-19 or Pneumonia.

The following is a summary of the dataset.

| Number of Classes  | 3     | 
| :-------- | :------- | 
| Class Details | Normal, Viral Pneumonia, Covid |
| Amount of data | 251 Data Train, 66 Data Validation | 

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this experiment is as follows.

| dense_1 (Dense) | (None, 3) | 195 |
| Total params: 1,089,683 |
| Trainable params: 1,089,683 |
| Non-trainable params: 0 |

## Model Evaluation
Model training is performed with `epoch = 50` and uses an Early Stopping callback which will stop model training if `val_accuracy` has converged to a value.
From the results of the training, the evaluation of the model in the last epoch (epochs = 24) was obtained as follows.
| Metrics  | Value |
| :-------- | :------- |
| Accuracy | 1.0000 |
| Loss | 0.0036 |
| Val Accuracy | 0.9062 |
| Val Loss | 0.2128 |
